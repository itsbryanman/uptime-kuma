# Uptime Kuma

Uptime Kuma is a self-hosted monitoring solution designed to help individuals and teams track the health, uptime, and performance of their websites, APIs, and other network services. This project offers a production-ready version of the popular open-source tool, incorporating advanced scheduling, concurrency limits, comprehensive notification integrations, and historical logging for deeper insights.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Tracks uptime status and response times for HTTP(S), TCP, and Ping endpoints.
  
- **Parallel Execution with Concurrency Control**  
  Efficiently handles hundreds of monitors, using asynchronous checks and a configurable concurrency limit.
  
- **Extended Notification System**  
  Supports Discord, Slack, Telegram, and more, with retry logic and exponential backoff.
  
- **Historical Logs and Analytics**  
  Stores check results in a database for long-term analysis and trend insights.
  
- **Advanced Configuration**  
  Allows custom headers, authentication, and expected status codes for complex endpoints.
  
- **Dockerized for Production**  
  Provides multi-stage Docker builds and Docker Compose configurations for a lightweight production environment.
  
- **One-Click Deployment**  
  Deployable on Railway using a `railway.json` config for seamless cloud hosting.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** v14+ (if running locally without Docker)  
- **npm** v6+ or **yarn** (for dependency management)  
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (if using container-based setups)  
- **Git** (to clone and manage source code)  
- **Railway account** (optional, for cloud deployment)

## Getting Started

### Local Installation (Node.js)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/uptime-kuma.git
   cd uptime-kuma
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Installs all backend dependencies (express, sequelize, node-cron, etc.).

3. **Configure Environment**:
   - Update `config/config.env` with your desired settings (port, database URL, concurrency limit).
   - Adjust `config/notification.json` for notification channels (Discord, Slack, Telegram, etc.).

4. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   node backend/app.js
   ```
   The application will run on the port set in `config/config.env` (default `4000`).

## Docker Usage

### Single Container

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t uptime-kuma .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name uptime-kuma \
     -p 4000:4000 \
     --env-file ./config/config.env \
     uptime-kuma
   ```
   The service is now available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Docker Compose

1. **Edit `docker/docker-compose.yml`** (if necessary):
   - Confirm `env_file` is set to the path of your `config.env`.
   - Ensure volume mappings are correct for `database.sqlite`.

2. **Start the Service**:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   The application will start in the background, accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Deployment on Railway

1. **Create a New Project** on [Railway](https://railway.app/).
2. **Link Your GitHub Repo** containing Uptime Kuma to the new project.
3. **Set Environment Variables** from `config.env` in the Railway dashboard.
4. **Deploy**:  
   Railway automatically detects the `railway.json` and `docker/Dockerfile` to build and run your app.  
   Once deployment completes, view your live service URL to confirm uptime checks are functioning.

---

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables** (`config/config.env`):
  - `PORT`: Port for the Node.js app (default `4000`).
  - `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for SQLite (or other DB if configured).
  - `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT`: Controls the number of simultaneous monitor checks.

- **Notifications** (`config/notification.json`):
  - `discordWebhookUrl`, `slackWebhookUrl`, `telegramBotToken`, etc.
  - `retryPolicy`: Defines `maxRetries` and `baseDelayMs` for exponential backoff.
